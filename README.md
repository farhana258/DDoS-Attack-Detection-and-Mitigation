# DDoS-Attack-Detection-and-Mitigation
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to obstruct a server, service, or network's regular traffic by saturating the target or its surrounding infrastructure with an excessive amount of internet traffic.
By using numerous compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic, DDoS attacks are made effective. Computers and other networked resources, like as IoT devices, can be exploited machines.

## Motivation
DDoS mitigation is essential as a protective layer for businesses operating at the edge with mission-critical operations that cannot afford downtime. DDoS mitigation helps keep these operations and services available continuously. SDN enables network planning, building, and operation. Data centers are at considerable risk from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
SDN networks are constantly the target of new security threats and attacks, in particular Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

##  Objectives: 
* To implement a network using mininet and Ryu controller
* To generate the dataset
* To apply Random Forest Machine learning algorithm to detect DDoS attack
* To add mitigation module
###  Software and Hardware requirement specification:
* Windows/ Linux/ macOS
* Virtualization software (VMware/virtual box)
* Ryu controller
* Mininet software
* Wire shark (for network monitoring)
